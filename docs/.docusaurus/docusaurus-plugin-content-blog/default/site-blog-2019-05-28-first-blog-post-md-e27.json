  "description": "One time, I was training a Microsoft Official Course about Power Platform, I was asked how can one generate some testing data to Dataverse. Had no idea. I researched quite a while and couldn't find anything just right for citizen developers. There are so many mock data generators, JSON fakers, data seeders and so on. None I could find makes it easy for non-programmers to use. So Mockster was born.",
