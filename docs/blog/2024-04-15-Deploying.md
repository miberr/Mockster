Certification process has finally reach deployment stage. This means Microsoft is deploying Mockster as a connector to all their datacenters currenty. That's awesome. 🥳

So you might find Mockster in Power Automate, Power Apps or Logic Apps already. If you don't, give a couple of weeks for the deployment to roll out completely ⏳

I really hope I'm able to help some citizen developers with Mockster. (Pro Devs, you are welcome as well ofc 😍)
