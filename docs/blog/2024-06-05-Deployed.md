Mockster has now passed certification and has been deployed througout Microsofts servers. It has been quite a journey, and we are finally in public preview! This means that for a while there is preview label on the connector, but all the functionality is there to be used. We'll get generally available after some time has passed and Mockster finds its users.

Certification path has been quite interesting and I've personally learned so much about different aspects of Microsoft Power Platform. As a senior consultant on Power Platform this experience has been priceless. Can't wait to get through that final hurdle of getting preview tag away. We'll get there.

If you have any questions or suggestions for further development, please visit Mocksters [GitHub](https://github.com/miberr/mockster). If you like using Mockster, please consider supporting me via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/miberr).

Happy developing with mockstered data üòç
