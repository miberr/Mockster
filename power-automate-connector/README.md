## Mockster Connector
One time, I was training a Microsoft Official Course about Power Platform, I was asked how can one generate some testing data to Dataverse. Had no idea. I researched quite a while and couldn't find anything just right for citizen developers. There are so many mock data generators, JSON fakers, data seeders and so on. None I could find makes it easy for non-programmers to use. So Mockster was born. 

Mockster is an implementation of [FakerJS](https://fakerjs.dev) exposed as an REST API. I've also created a Microsoft Power Platform connector for easy use for citizen developers.

If you find Mockster usefull, please consider supporting me and Mockster by buying a cup of cofee trough GitHub Sponsors.

## Prerequisites
You will need the following to proceed:
* As Mockster is a premium connector, you'll need a premium lisenced user or a *[Developer plan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-gb/developerplan/)**, where you can test premium features without lisence. Information about license can be found from **[Microsoft Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130)

## Thats it!
You are good to go and generate some mock data!
