# What's Mockster?

One time, I was training a Microsoft Official Course about Power Platform, I was asked how can one generate some testing data to Dataverse. Had no idea. I researched quite a while and couldn't find anything just right for citizen developers. There are so many mock data generators, JSON fakers, data seeders and so on. None I could find makes it easy for non-programmers to use. So Mockster was born. 

Mockster is an implementation of [FakerJS](https://fakerjs.dev) exposed as an REST API. I've also created a Microsoft Power Platform connector for easy use for citizen developers.

## What's in it?

In Mockster there is many different modules, or endpoints, to be utilized. These include things like `Persons`, `Products`, or `Companies` amd a lot more. For exaustive list please visit Mocksters [website](https://mockster.dev/docs).

## Mockster in Microsoft Power Platform

Mockster is meant for citizen developers first. As such, there will be a certified connector in Microsoft Power Platform. For time being, the connector is pending certification.
